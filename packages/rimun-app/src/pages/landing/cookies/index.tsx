      <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or
        mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to
        remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font
        size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you
        don&apos;t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the
        site or browse from one page to another.
      </p>
